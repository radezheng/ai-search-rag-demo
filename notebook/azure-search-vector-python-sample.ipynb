    "# Vector search in Python (Azure AI Search)\n",
    "This code demonstrates how to use Azure AI Search by using the push API to insert vectors into your search index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook to generate text embeddings using Azure OpenAI, insert those embeddings into a vector store in Azure AI Search, and perform a wide variety of vector search queries, including vector searches with metadata filtering and hybrid (text + vectors) search. The code uses Azure OpenAI to generate embeddings for title and content fields. You'll need access to Azure OpenAI to run this demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code reads the `text-sample.json` file, which contains the input data for which embeddings need to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a combination of human-readable text and embeddings that can be pushed into a search index.\n",
